# Processing (in Java) Projects

Part of a collection of projects made through Processing in Java!

## Pong Arcade Game

A project on a take of another arcade classic, [Pong](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pong)! In this project, the user will play against the computer in this table tennis game. Here is the [main program](/PongPractice2/PongPractice2.pde), which acts as the skeleton of whole project!

### About the Code
The code is largely spread out by the mode of the game, including:

|                 Modes                      |  
|             -------------                  |  
| [Intro to Game](/PongPractice2/intro.pde)  |
| [Game Play](/PongPractice2/game.pde)       | 
| [Game Pause](/PongPractice2/pause.pde)     | 
| [End of Game](/PongPractice2/gameover.pde) | 
| and [more](/PongPractice2)!                |
